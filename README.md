# Bioinformatics Algorithms - an active learning approach
1A: Given string s and integer k, find all most frequent k-mers in s, where k-mer is a string of length k. Account for overlapping occurences in s. \
1B: Given a DNA string s, return the reverse complement of s. \
1C: Given string s and p, return all starting positions in s where p is a substring. \
1D: Given string s, integers k, L and t, return all distinct k-mers forming (L,t) clumps in s, where a (L,t) clump is an interval of s of length L in which this k-mer appears at least t times. \
1E: Given a string s, return all integers i minimizing skew_i where skew_i = occ(G)-occ(C), where occ(X) denotes the number of occurences of X in the first i nucleotides.
